            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Parker Slaughter. I'm an aspiring artist and cosplayer from Wichita, Kansas.
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite things to do include drawing and sketching in my sketchbook, singing in the car, and spending time with my boyfriend. I also love watching horror games, my favorite genre being analog horror.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have only recently started digital art so I'm trying new techniques all the time! I mostly draw characters in an anime style as that is how I started drawing, also drawing lots of eyes.

            <h3>Favorite Quote</h3>
            <p>
                I have two quotes, both from animes I have watched and loved.
            </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                    "Life isn't that sweet. That's why everyone wants sweet things." <br>
                    <cite>- Undertaker, Black Butler</cite>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                    "Sometimes things that you start on a whim end up becoming very important to you, too. To get started, I think you just need a little bit of curiosity."<br>
                    <cite>- Kiyoko Shimizu, Haikyuu</cite>
                    </p>
